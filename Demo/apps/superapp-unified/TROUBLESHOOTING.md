# üîß Troubleshooting Guide - Coom√únity SuperApp

## üö® Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: Builder.io Cookie Sandbox Error
**Error:** `SecurityError: Failed to read the 'cookie' property from 'Document': The document is sandboxed and lacks the 'allow-same-origin' flag.`

**Root Cause:** Builder.io iframe was sandboxed without proper permissions to access cookies.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Updated `.builder/config.json` with proper iframe sandbox permissions
2. Added security configuration to allow cookies and storage
3. Added development flags to suppress warnings

**Files Modified:**
- `Demo/apps/superapp-unified/.builder/config.json`

### Issue 2: Missing Analytics Endpoints (404 Errors)
**Error:** `POST http://localhost:1111/analytics/video-progress 404 (Not Found)`

**Root Cause:** SuperApp frontend was trying to call analytics endpoints that don't exist yet in the NestJS backend.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Modified `useInteractiveVideo` hook to gracefully handle 404 errors
2. Updated all video components to show informative console messages instead of errors
3. Added proper error categorization for development vs production

**Files Modified:**
- `Demo/apps/superapp-unified/src/hooks/useInteractiveVideo.ts`
- `Demo/apps/superapp-unified/src/components/modules/uplay/components/InteractiveVideoPlayerOverlay.tsx`

### Issue 3: Port Configuration
**Issue:** SuperApp was trying to use port 3005 automatically when 3001 was occupied.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Cleared processes using port 3001
2. Updated environment configuration to use correct port
3. Verified both frontend (3001) and backend (3002) are running correctly

**Files Modified:**
- `Demo/apps/superapp-unified/.env` (VITE_BASE_URL)

## üéØ Current Status

‚úÖ **Builder.io Cookie Access:** Fixed with proper iframe sandbox configuration
‚úÖ **Analytics Endpoints:** Gracefully handled with informative development messages
‚úÖ **Port Configuration:** SuperApp running on http://localhost:2222
‚úÖ **Backend Connection:** Backend running on http://localhost:1111

## üîç Development Notes

### Analytics Endpoints To Be Implemented in Backend
The following endpoints are expected by the frontend but not yet implemented:

1. `POST /analytics/video-progress` - Save video watching progress
2. `POST /analytics/question-answer` - Track question answers
3. `POST /analytics/question-skip` - Track skipped questions  
4. `POST /analytics/video-completion` - Track video completion
5. `POST /analytics/video-question` - Track video question interactions

### Error Handling Strategy
- **404 Errors:** Show informative console.info messages during development
- **Other Errors:** Log as warnings with full error details
- **Production:** All analytics errors should be silent to avoid user disruption

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Backend Development:** Implement the missing analytics endpoints in NestJS
2. **Testing:** Verify Builder.io integration works without cookie errors
3. **Monitoring:** Set up proper error tracking for production environment

## üõ†Ô∏è Commands for Verification

```bash
# Check services are running
curl -I http://localhost:2222      # SuperApp Frontend
curl -I http://localhost:1111/health # Backend Health Check

# Check for port conflicts
lsof -ti:3001    # Should show SuperApp process
lsof -ti:3002    # Should show Backend process

# Start ecosystem (from project root)
npm run dev      # Starts all services via Turborepo
```

      const focusableElements = document.querySelectorAll(
        'button, [href], input, select, textarea, [tabindex]:not([tabindex="-1"])'
      );
      
      // Test tab order
      focusableElements.forEach((el, index) => {
        console.log(`Tab ${index + 1}: ${el.tagName} - ${el.textContent || el.ariaLabel || el.title}`);
      });
    });
  },
  
  tableNavigationTest: async (page) => {
    // Test table navigation patterns
    const tableData = await page.evaluate(() => {
      const tables = document.querySelectorAll('table');
      return Array.from(tables).map(table => ({
        hasCaption: !!table.querySelector('caption'),
        headerCount: table.querySelectorAll('th').length,
        rowCount: table.querySelectorAll('tr').length,

      modals.forEach(modal => {
        const focusableInModal = modal.querySelectorAll(
          'button, [href], input, select, textarea, [tabindex]:not([tabindex="-1"])'
        );
        console.log(`Modal has ${focusableInModal.length} focusable elements`);
      });
    });

// Automated test session recording
const testSessionRecorder = {
  startSession: async (userId, testType) => {
    const sessionData = {
      userId,
      testType,
      startTime: new Date(),
      interactions: [],
      errors: [],
      completedTasks: [],
      feedback: {}
    };
    
    // Start screen recording
    // Start interaction logging
    // Initialize error tracking
    
    return sessionData;
  },
  
  logInteraction: (sessionData, interaction) => {
    sessionData.interactions.push({
      timestamp: new Date(),
      type: interaction.type,
      element: interaction.element,
      action: interaction.action,
      success: interaction.success
    });
  },
  
  endSession: async (sessionData) => {
    sessionData.endTime = new Date();
    sessionData.duration = sessionData.endTime - sessionData.startTime;
    
    // Save session data
    // Generate report
    // Upload recordings
    
    return sessionData;
  }
};
```

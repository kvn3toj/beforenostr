          "recommendation": "Replace `console.log('Ver detalle de reciprocidad')` with a function call passed down via props, for example, `onViewDetails()`, to handle the button click action.",

          "message": "The `sx` prop for the 'Ver Detalle' button contains complex, inline styles including gradients, transitions, and hover effects. While functional, this can make the component harder to read and maintain. Consider abstracting some of these styles.",
          "recommendation": "For complex or reusable styles, consider defining them as separate style objects or using the theme's customization capabilities. This improves readability and potentially allows for style reuse.",

          "message": "The `cardActions` JSX element is defined inside the component function, meaning it's recreated on every render. While not a major performance issue for this small element, for larger or more complex JSX, this pattern can sometimes lead to unnecessary work or issues with memoization.",
          "recommendation": "If the `cardActions` were more complex or dependent on props that change frequently, you might consider memoizing it using `useMemo` or defining it outside the component if it has no dependencies. In this specific case, the impact is minimal, but it's a pattern to be aware of.",
